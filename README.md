About:
This is a horror movie app, where a user can singup/login and see horror movies, write reviews on horror movies and see currently playing horror movies using a third party api.

Instructions:
clone and cd into repo
make sure the horror-movie-api server is running
run npm install
run npm run dev
Note: For the now playing page I used a third party api(https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started), you will need to get an api key from there site to make it work.
